                    <p><em>Last Updated: January 1, 2023</em></p>
                    
                    <p>At Compress Image Resizer, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our online image compression tool.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                    <p>Our image compression tool is designed with privacy in mind:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No Image Upload:</strong> All image processing occurs directly in your web browser. We do not upload your images to our servers or any third-party servers.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Registration Required:</strong> You can use our tool without creating an account or providing any personal information.</li>
                        <li><strong>Basic Analytics:</strong> We use Google Analytics to collect anonymous usage statistics about our website (pages visited, duration of visit, etc.). This helps us improve our service.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> We use cookies for essential website functions and to support our advertising partners (see Advertising section below).</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>Advertising</h2>
                    <p>To support the free operation of this tool, we display advertisements provided by Google AdSense. These ads may use cookies to personalize the advertising content you see.</p>
                    
                    <p>Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to our website or other websites.</p>
                    
                    <p>Google's use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and/or other sites on the Internet.</p>
                    
                    <p>Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">Google's Ads Settings</a>.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Data Security</h2>
                    <p>Since all image processing happens in your browser, your images never leave your device unless you choose to download the compressed versions. This provides the highest level of security and privacy for your files.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                    <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> For anonymous website usage statistics.</li>
                        <li><strong>Google AdSense:</strong> For displaying advertisements.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>These services have their own privacy policies which we recommend you review.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
                    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>
