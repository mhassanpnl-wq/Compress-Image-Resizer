                    <h3>Precise Size Control</h3>
                    <p>Unlike other tools that only offer quality sliders, our tool lets you specify exact target file sizes in KB or MB. This is especially useful when you need to meet strict file size requirements for web platforms or email attachments.</p>

                    <h3>Batch Processing</h3>
                    <p>Optimize multiple images at once with consistent settings, saving you time when working with large collections of photos or website assets.</p>
                    
                    <h3>No Server Uploads</h3>
                    <p>Your images are processed directly in your browser. This means faster processing (no upload/download delays) and complete privacy - your images never leave your computer.</p>
