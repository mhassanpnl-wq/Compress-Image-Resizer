                                <p>There are no limits on the number of images you can process. However, for very large batches (100+ images), we recommend processing them in smaller groups for better performance.</p>

                            <h3>How does the image compression work?</h3>
                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>Our tool uses advanced algorithms to reduce file size while preserving visual quality. For JPEG and WEBP images, this involves adjusting the compression level. For PNG images, we optimize the encoding without losing any data (lossless compression).</p>

                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>All processing happens directly in your web browser. Your images are never uploaded to our servers, which ensures complete privacy and faster processing times.</p>

                                <p>We support JPEG, PNG, and WEBP formats for both input and output. You can convert between these formats during the compression process.</p>

                                <p>The practical limit depends on your device's memory and processing power. Most modern computers can handle images up to 20-30 megapixels. For very large images, we recommend resizing them first before compression.</p>

                                <p>In the compression settings, enter your desired file size in the "Target Size (KB)" field. Our tool will automatically adjust the compression level to meet your target as closely as possible.</p>

                            <h3>Will compressing my images reduce their quality?</h3>
                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>Some quality reduction is inevitable with lossy formats like JPEG and WEBP, but our tool is designed to minimize visible quality loss. You can adjust the quality slider to find the perfect balance between file size and image quality for your needs.</p>

                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>Reduction depends on the original image and format. Typically, you can achieve 50-80% reduction for JPEGs with minimal quality loss. PNG files can often be reduced by 20-50% with lossless compression.</p>

                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>This can happen if the original PNG was already highly optimized. PNG uses lossless compression, so we can't reduce quality to achieve smaller sizes. In such cases, consider converting to JPEG or WEBP if some quality loss is acceptable.</p>

                                <p>Yes! Our tool lets you adjust dimensions and apply compression in a single step. This is often the most effective way to reduce file size significantly.</p>

                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>When you enter either width or height (but not both), our tool automatically calculates the other dimension to maintain the original aspect ratio. If you need specific dimensions that don't match the original ratio, you can enter both values.</p>

                                <p>First, try refreshing the page. If that doesn't help, ensure you're using an updated version of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari. Older browsers or mobile browsers may have limited support. Clearing your browser cache can also resolve some issues.</p>

                                <p>Processing time depends on your device's performance and the size/number of images. Very large images (10+ megapixels) or large batches may take longer. Try processing fewer images at a time if you experience performance issues.</p>

                                <p>Try these steps: 1) Lower the quality setting, 2) Resize the image to smaller dimensions, 3) Convert to WEBP format (often provides better compression than JPEG), 4) For PNGs with transparency, ensure you're not converting to JPEG (which doesn't support transparency).</p>
